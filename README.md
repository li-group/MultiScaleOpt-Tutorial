# A Tutorial of Multi-time Scale Optimization Models and Algorithms
This repo implements different algorithms to solve a multi-time scale optimization problem. 


The model of the multi-time scale optimization is given in our paper. We use the following algorithms to solve the model:
1. Full-space method
2. Benders Decomposition
3. Lagrangian Decomposition with cutting plane method
4. Lagrangian Decomposition with subgradients method
5. Dantzig Wolfe Decomposition
6. PAMSO

The data used in the problem is in newgenexp.xlsx. The codes can be accessed through the Jupyter Notebooks in the repo.
